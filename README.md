# ðŸ’© Top Of The Poops ðŸ’©

This is the website for ðŸ’© Top of the Poops ðŸ’©

The ðŸ’© face is happy - but really we are  	ðŸ˜­

We try to be as transparent as possible - although we are sad
that the water companies of England and Wales are not so transparent.

Being open about data formats, technology and data is key. By opening
all our data and technology, we hope that this will encourage everyone
top "show what you have" - only in this way can we know what is happening.

Sure, we might have implemented something imperfectly, or we might have
made a mistake in our interpretation of a data item.

If we are wrong or make a mistake - please correct us.
